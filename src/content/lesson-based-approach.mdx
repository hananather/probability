## Introduction to Probability

Welcome to this lesson-based approach to learning probability. This style of teaching breaks complex concepts into small, digestible pieces with frequent knowledge checks.

<SectionBreak />

## Sample Spaces

A **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. For example:
- When flipping a coin: S = {"Heads", "Tails"}
- When rolling a die: S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Each element in the sample space represents one possible outcome.

<QuizBreak
  question="What is the sample space when flipping two coins?"
  options={[
    "{H, T}",
    "{HH, HT, TH, TT}",
    "{2H, 1H1T, 2T}",
    "{H, T, H, T}"
  ]}
  correctIndex={1}
  explanation="When flipping two coins, we need to consider all possible combinations: HH (both heads), HT (first heads, second tails), TH (first tails, second heads), and TT (both tails)."
/>

## Events

An **event** is any subset of the sample space. Events can be:
- Simple (containing only one outcome)
- Compound (containing multiple outcomes)

For a die roll:
- Simple event: "Rolling a 4" = {4}
- Compound event: "Rolling an even number" = {2, 4, 6}

<QuizBreak
  question="Which of the following is a compound event when rolling a die?"
  options={[
    "Getting a 3",
    "Getting a number less than 4",
    "Getting exactly 5",
    "Rolling the die"
  ]}
  correctIndex={1}
  explanation="'Getting a number less than 4' includes the outcomes {1, 2, 3}, making it a compound event with multiple outcomes."
/>

<SectionBreak />

## Probability of Events

The probability of an event A is calculated as:

$$P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}$$

Key properties:
- 0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1 for any event A
- P(S) = 1 (certain event)
- P(∅) = 0 (impossible event)

<QuizBreak
  question="What is the probability of rolling a prime number (2, 3, 5) on a fair six-sided die?"
  options={[
    "1/6",
    "1/3",
    "1/2",
    "2/3"
  ]}
  correctIndex={2}
  explanation="Prime numbers on a die are {2, 3, 5}, which is 3 outcomes out of 6 total. So P(prime) = 3/6 = 1/2."
/>

<SectionBreak />

## Complementary Events

The complement of event A (denoted A') consists of all outcomes not in A.

Key relationship:
$$P(A') = 1 - P(A)$$

This is often useful when it's easier to calculate what we don't want.

<QuizBreak
  question="If P(rain tomorrow) = 0.3, what is P(no rain tomorrow)?"
  options={[
    "0.3",
    "0.5",
    "0.7",
    "1.3"
  ]}
  correctIndex={2}
  explanation="The probability of no rain is the complement of rain: P(no rain) = 1 - P(rain) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7"
/>

## Summary

You've completed this lesson on basic probability concepts! Key takeaways:

1. **Sample Space**: All possible outcomes
2. **Events**: Subsets of the sample space
3. **Probability**: Ratio of favorable to total outcomes
4. **Complements**: P(A') = 1 - P(A)

This execute-program style approach ensures you understand each concept before moving forward, building a strong foundation for more advanced topics.
