## Usage

### Adding Quiz to a Chapter

1. Create a new page route:
```jsx
// src/app/chapterX/quiz/page.jsx
import { ChapterQuiz } from '@/components/quiz/ChapterQuiz';

export default function ChapterXQuizPage({ searchParams }) {
  const version = searchParams?.version || 'engineering';
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-neutral-950 py-8">
      <div className="container mx-auto px-4">
        <ChapterQuiz chapterId={X} version={version} />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

2. Add to sidebar navigation:
```js
// src/config/sidebar-chapters.js
{ title: 'üìù End of Chapter Quiz', url: '/chapterX/quiz' }
```

### Adding Questions

Edit `src/lib/quiz/questionBank.js`:

```js
{
  id: "ch1-qX",
  type: "multiple-choice", // or "multi-select"
  topic: "1.X Topic Name",
  difficulty: "easy|medium|hard",
  question: "Question text with LaTeX support",
  options: [
    "Option A",
    "Option B",
    "Option C",
    "Option D"
  ],
  correct: 2, // For single choice (0-indexed)
  // OR
  correct: [0, 2], // For multi-select
  explanation: "Detailed explanation shown after answering"
}
```

## Question Bank Structure

### Chapter 1: Introduction to Probabilities (15 questions)
- Sample Spaces & Events (2 questions)
- Set Operations & Venn Diagrams (2 questions)
- Counting Techniques (1 question)
- Ordered Samples (2 questions)
- Unordered Samples (2 questions)

## LocalStorage Schema

```js
{
  // Quiz attempts by chapter
  "quiz_attempts": {
    "1": [{
      id: "timestamp",
      date: "ISO string",
      score: 12,
      percentage: 80,
      timeSpent: 1200, // seconds
      answers: {...}
    }]
  },
  
  // Best scores
  "quiz_best_scores": {
    "1": 85,
    "2": 92
  },
  
  // User preferences
  "quiz_preferences": {
    showTimer: true,
    immediateFeeback: false,
    version: "engineering"
  },
  
  // Current session (for resume)
  "quiz_current_session": {
    chapterId: 1,
    currentQuestion: 5,
    answers: {...},
    timeRemaining: 1500,
    flaggedQuestions: [2, 7]
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Question Writing
- Keep questions clear and unambiguous
- Ensure LaTeX formulas render correctly
- Provide helpful explanations
- Order questions by topic progression
- Mix difficulty levels throughout

### Multi-Select Questions
- Clearly indicate "Select all that apply"
- Ensure at least 2 correct options
- Avoid "None of the above" in multi-select
- Provide comprehensive explanations

### Performance Optimization
- Questions load once at quiz start
- LocalStorage writes are batched
- MathJax processes on-demand
- Timer runs independently
