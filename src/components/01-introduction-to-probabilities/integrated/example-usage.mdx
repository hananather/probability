# Set Theory Challenges

Master fundamental set theory concepts through interactive challenges:

<SetTheoryChallenges />

## Challenge Structure

The challenges are organized into three progressive levels:

### Level 1: Basic Set Operations
- Union (A∪B) - Understanding "or" operations
- Intersection (A∩B) - Understanding "and" operations  
- Complement (A') - Understanding "not" operations
- Triple intersection - Finding common elements

### Level 2: Fundamental Laws
- De Morgan's Laws - How complement distributes
- Distributive Laws - How operations interact
- Identity Laws - Properties with empty and universal sets

### Level 3: Advanced Challenges
- Region isolation - Finding specific combinations
- Symmetric difference - Elements in exactly one set
- Complex expressions - Multi-step problems
- Counting challenges - Working with cardinality

## Educational Features

1. **Real-time Feedback**: The Venn diagram highlights regions as you build expressions
2. **Hints System**: Each challenge includes a hint to guide learning
3. **Multiple Solutions**: Some challenges accept equivalent expressions
4. **Progress Tracking**: Track completion across all challenge levels
5. **Drag Mode**: Enable dragging to explore how set positions affect intersections

## Integration Notes

To use this component in your course:

```jsx
import { SetTheoryChallenges } from '@/components/01-introduction-to-probabilities/integrated/SetTheoryChallenges';

// In your MDX file or component
<SetTheoryChallenges />
```

The component is self-contained and includes:
- Interactive Venn diagram visualization
- Expression builder with notation buttons
- Challenge progression system
- Real-time validation and feedback
