# Fixed Issues (2025-08-03)

## Removed Aspect Column from ComparisonTable
- Updated ComparisonTable component to make aspect column optional (default hidden)
- Only components that explicitly need the aspect column now show it
- This reduces empty space and makes tables more efficient
- Updated GoldStandardShowcase to explicitly show aspect column where needed

## Made ComparisonTable More Compact
- Reduced padding from py-3 px-4 to py-2 px-3 for more consolidated appearance
- Removed min-width constraints (was min-w-[1000px] and min-w-[600px])
- Tables now use same compact dimensions as the sample spaces table
- More efficient use of space while maintaining readability

Over all love the interactive explorer:

Mirror issues:
- over all: make all the compoents navigation standardized with the tabbed application. This means using arrow keys to navigate 
- next and peviovis buttions are standardized at the bottom clearly rather than the top for better UI experience. 
- remove "Mark as complete" and standardized this with the Tabbed compoent; can all also called this "next compoent" etc rather than


Specific Fixes: 
src/components/01-introduction-to-probabilities/01-foundations/Tab4InteractiveTab-StaticVisual.jsx

- Don't like "Static visual" -> change to something better.
- Key Concepts latex does not render properly fix that



# 2 
src/components/01-introduction-to-probabilities/01-foundations/Tab4InteractiveTab-VennDiagram.jsx

- the "Probability Operations" need to be a bit more spaced out (the green highlight doesn't over the entire buttion which makes UI unpolished)
- 

# src/components/01-introduction-to-probabilities/01-foundations/Tab4InteractiveTab-StepByStep.jsx
- the step by step use should be able to: using arrow keys to navigate 
- next and peviovis buttions are standardized at the bottom clearly rather than the top for better UI experience. 

# 4:
src/components/01-introduction-to-probabilities/01-foundations/Tab4InteractiveTab-ProgressiveCards.jsx

- there is an error


# 5 (src/components/01-introduction-to-probabilities/01-foundations/Tab4InteractiveTab-Hybrid.jsx)


- fix latex issues; 
- the step by step use should be able to: using arrow keys to navigate 
- next and peviovis buttions are standardized at the bottom clearly rather than the top for better UI experience.

Error: 
"Console Error


Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component calls setState inside useEffect, but useEffect either doesn't have a dependency array, or one of the dependencies changes on every render.
