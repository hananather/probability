# Chapter 1 Tutorial Implementation Summary

## Completed Components

### ✅ 1-1-1: Sample Spaces and Events
- Already implemented with academic tutorial content
- Covers sample space Ω, events as subsets, set operations

### ✅ 1-2-1: Counting Techniques
**Tutorial Content:**
1. Fundamental Counting Principle
2. Permutations: P(n,r) = n!/(n-r)!
3. Combinations: C(n,r) = n!/(r!(n-r)!)
4. Tree visualization explanation

**Key Mathematical Concepts:**
- Order matters vs order doesn't matter
- Factorial notation
- Relationship between permutations and combinations

### ✅ 1-3-1: Ordered Samples
**Tutorial Content:**
1. Sampling fundamentals
2. With replacement: n^r outcomes
3. Without replacement: P(n,r) outcomes
4. Practical applications (PIN codes, card dealing)

**Key Mathematical Concepts:**
- Independence vs dependence
- Effect of replacement on probability calculations
- Real-world applications

### ❌ 1-4-x: Skipped (as requested)
- Multiple components with special considerations
- To be addressed separately

### ✅ 1-5-1: Probability of Events
**Tutorial Content:**
1. Classical probability: P(A) = |A|/|S|
2. Event notation using sets
3. Law of Large Numbers
4. Experimental vs theoretical probability

**Key Mathematical Concepts:**
- Equally likely outcomes assumption
- Convergence of relative frequency
- Probability axioms (0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1)

### ✅ 1-6-1: Conditional Probability
- Already implemented with academic tutorial content
- Covers P(B|A) = P(A∩B)/P(A), perspectives, empirical validation

## Implementation Details

All components now:
1. Import tutorial content from `/src/tutorials/chapter1.js`
2. Pass tutorial props to VisualizationContainer
3. Display standardized violet tutorial button in title bar
4. Restart tutorial when button is clicked

## Tutorial Content Philosophy

Each tutorial:
- Starts with mathematical definitions
- Uses proper notation (subscripts, mathematical symbols)
- Explains theory before interaction
- Avoids marketing language
- Focuses on conceptual understanding
- Includes practical applications where relevant

## Next Steps

1. Test all components to ensure tutorials appear correctly
2. Review content for mathematical accuracy
3. Consider adding more advanced concepts for each topic
4. Implement tutorials for remaining chapters
