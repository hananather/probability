# Reference Sheet Updates Summary

## Overview
Completed comprehensive review and enhancement of all 7 chapter reference sheets to ensure:
1. Complete coverage of formulas from course materials
2. Logical pedagogical organization
3. Proper LaTeX rendering with best practices
4. Minimal space usage for obscure formulas

## Changes Made

### Chapter 1: Introduction to Probabilities
- **Status**: No changes needed
- **Organization**: Excellent pedagogical flow maintained
- Basic probability → Set operations → Counting → Conditional probability → Independence → Total probability → Bayes

### Chapter 2: Discrete Random Variables  
- **Added**: Hypergeometric Distribution (Section 7)
  - Formula: P(X = k) = [C(K,k) × C(N-K,n-k)] / C(N,n)
  - Compact format with mean and variance
  - Used for sampling without replacement from finite populations
- **Organization**: Maintained logical flow with new addition
- **Updated**: Section numbering for consistency

### Chapter 3: Continuous Random Variables
- **Status**: No changes needed
- **Note**: Contains extra distributions (Beta, Chi-square, t) beyond course scope but valuable as reference
- **Organization**: Excellent flow from fundamentals to advanced topics

### Chapter 4: Descriptive Statistics & Sampling
- **Added**: Alternative Means (Section 2) - compact format
  - Geometric mean: (∏xᵢ)^(1/n)
  - Harmonic mean: n/Σ(1/xᵢ)  
  - Trimmed mean: Remove outliers before averaging
- **Added**: Kurtosis to Shape Measures (Section 5)
  - Formula: Kurt = E[(X-μ)⁴]/σ⁴ - 3
  - Minimal space, added as note about tail heaviness
- **Updated**: All section numbers adjusted accordingly

### Chapter 5: Estimation
- **Status**: No changes needed
- **Organization**: Perfect pedagogical flow
- Fundamentals → Z-intervals → t-intervals → Proportions → Sample size → Interpretation

### Chapter 6: Hypothesis Testing
- **Status**: No changes needed
- **Organization**: Excellent progression
- Fundamentals → Error types → One-sample → Two-sample → P-values → Critical values

### Chapter 7: Linear Regression
- **Added**: Adjusted R² to Section 6 (Coefficient of Determination)
  - Formula: R²_adj = 1 - [(1-R²)(n-1)/(n-p-1)]
  - Compact format as note about adjusting for predictors
- **Organization**: Maintained logical flow

## Design Principles Applied

1. **Pedagogical Order**: Each chapter flows from basic concepts to advanced topics
2. **Space Efficiency**: Obscure formulas (kurtosis, alternative means) use minimal space with compact formatting
3. **LaTeX Best Practices**: 
   - Used `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` for all LaTeX content
   - Proper escaping with double backslashes
   - Consistent formatting throughout
4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Important formulas prominent, specialized ones compact
5. **Completeness**: All essential formulas from course materials now included

## Result
All reference sheets are now:
- ✅ Complete with all formulas from course materials
- ✅ Pedagogically organized for optimal learning
- ✅ Space-efficient for obscure formulas
- ✅ Using LaTeX rendering best practices
- ✅ Production-ready
