# Histogram Component Color Fix

## Date: 2025-08-06

## Issue
The histogram components in section 4.2 were throwing errors:
- `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'colors.cyan[400]')`
- Components wouldn't load due to these errors
- User couldn't click "Start Demo" button or navigate to any sections

## Root Cause
The components were incorrectly trying to access colors from the design system using bracket notation like `colors.cyan[400]`, but the design system doesn't export colors in this format. The design system exports:
- Predefined hex colors in the `chart` property
- Tailwind class strings in other properties
- But NOT indexed color arrays like `cyan[400]`

## Files Affected
- `/src/components/04-descriptive-statistics-sampling/4-2-histograms/4-2-1-HistogramIntuitiveIntro.jsx`

## Solution
Replaced incorrect color references with proper hex color codes:

| Incorrect Usage | Correct Hex Code | Location |
|----------------|------------------|----------|
| `colors.cyan[400]` | `#06b6d4` | Line 89, 180 |
| `colors.cyan[600]` | `#0891b2` | Line 94 |
| `colors.gray[300]` | `#d1d5db` | Line 132 |
| `colors.gray[800]` | `#1f2937` | Line 179 |
| `colors.gray[100]` | `#f3f4f6` | Line 188 |

## Pattern to Follow
When using colors from the design system:
1. For D3/SVG: Use hex colors from `colorScheme.chart.primary`, etc.
2. For Tailwind classes: Use predefined strings from `colors.background`, `colors.text`, etc.
3. Never use bracket notation like `colors.colorName[shade]`

## Verification
- ✅ Build passes successfully
- ✅ No lint errors
- ✅ Components should now load without errors
- ✅ Other histogram components (4-2-2, 4-2-3) verified to have no similar issues
