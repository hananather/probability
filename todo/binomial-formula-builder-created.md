# Binomial Distribution Formula Builder - Created

## What was created
- `/src/components/02-discrete-random-variables/formula-builders/BinomialDistributionBuilder.jsx`
- New directory: `/src/components/02-discrete-random-variables/formula-builders/`

## Pattern followed
Exactly matched the Chapter 1 pattern from `BasicProbabilityBuilder.jsx`:
- Same structure and component organization
- Same interactive click-to-learn approach
- Same progress tracking system
- Same professional mathematical tone
- Emerald/green color theme as requested
- No emojis except ðŸ”‘ for Key Insight

## Interactive components
1. **P(X = k)** - The probability of exactly k successes
2. **C(n,k)** - The binomial coefficient (n choose k)  
3. **p^k** - Probability of k successes
4. **(1-p)^(n-k)** - Probability of (n-k) failures

## Features included
- Step-by-step formula building
- Alternative notation with expanded binomial coefficient
- Concrete examples (quality control scenario)
- Understanding progress tracker
- Key insight about multiplication principle
- Professional mathematical explanations

## Build status
