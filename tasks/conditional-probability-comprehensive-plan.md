# Comprehensive Plan for Teaching Conditional Probability Through Interactive Components

## Overall Learning Philosophy and Objectives

### Core Philosophy
- **Intuition Before Formulation**: Build visual and conceptual understanding before introducing formulas
- **Common Misconceptions as Teaching Opportunities**: Proactively address and correct typical misunderstandings
- **Real-World Context**: Ground abstract concepts in engineering and practical applications
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, layer complexity gradually
- **Active Learning**: Every interaction should teach something specific

### Primary Learning Objectives
1. Understand conditional probability as "updating beliefs given new information"
2. Master the relationship between P(A|B) and P(B|A) 
3. Develop intuition for when events are independent vs dependent
4. Apply Bayes' theorem to real-world problems
5. Recognize and avoid common probability fallacies

## Component-by-Component Breakdown

### Component 1: Foundation Builder - "What Changes When We Know Something?"

#### Learning Goals
- Introduce conditioning as "zooming in" on a subset of possibilities
- Show how probabilities rescale when we restrict the sample space
- Build intuition that P(A|B) means "of all B outcomes, what fraction are also A?"

#### Interactive Mechanics
- **Sample Space Visualizer**: Interactive rectangle representing Ω
  - Click to drop random points
  - Define regions A and B by drawing rectangles
  - "Condition on B" button that:
    - Visually zooms into region B
    - Shows only points that fell in B
    - Rescales probabilities to sum to 1 within B
  - Toggle between "Universe view" and "Given B view"

#### Visual Design
- Clean 2D space with grid overlay
- Events as semi-transparent colored regions
- Points accumulate to show density
- Smooth transitions when switching views
- Side panel showing:
  - P(A) in universe view
  - P(A|B) in conditional view

#### Common Misconceptions Addressed
- "P(A|B) and P(B|A) are the same thing"
  - Show explicit counter-example with asymmetric regions
- "Conditioning always increases probability"
  - Show cases where P(A|B) < P(A)

#### Assessment Approach
- Interactive challenges:
  - "Arrange A and B so that P(A|B) = 0.7"
