We want to enhance this componet with more mathematical rigour. 
Have a look at the corresponding section in (`course-materials/content`) for this compoent. 
Reflect ALL possible improvements we can make to the component. 
Remember we are ADDING additioanl content to componet, we are NOT replacing or removing any existing content. 
For each improvement you identity reflect on 5-7 possible solution, distill those down to 1-2 most best solutions and validate your assumptions before we begin implementing the improvement fixes. 


### Best Practices to Follow
- **LaTeX Rendering**: ALWAYS follow `/docs/latex-guide.md` exactly - use dangerouslySetInnerHTML pattern
- **Component Reuse**: Use existing VisualizationContainer, GraphContainer, ControlGroup components
- **Chapter 7 Style**: Match the structure and patterns from Chapter 7 components
- **Simplicity First**: Avoid complex drag-and-drop; use controlled, curated interactions
- **Animations**: Follow `/src/components/landing/landing-animations.jsx` for smooth, vibrant animations

### Quality Checklist
- [ ] All LaTeX renders correctly using processMathJax() pattern (`/docs/latex-guide.md`)
- [ ] Component follows existing chapter structure and navigation
- [ ] Animations are smooth (1.5s transitions) and use consistent colors
- [ ] No overlapping or cluttered UI elements
- [ ] All buttons and controls are properly wired up
- [ ] Component includes BackToHub navigation
- [ ] Code follows existing conventions (no unnecessary comments)
- [ ] Make sure the colours are consistent with Chapter 7
- [ ] Font sizes are also consistent with Chapter 7

### Development Process
1. Read and understand the task specification thoroughly
2. Study reference components mentioned in the task file
3. Implement following the exact structure outlined
4. Test all interactions and ensure smooth animations
5. Verify LaTeX rendering and mathematical accuracy

### Final Verification
After implementation, run:
```bash
npm run build && npm run lint
```
