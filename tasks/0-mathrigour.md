We want to enhance this component with more mathematical content but in a pedagogical way. 
Have a look at the corresponding section in (`course-materials/content`) for this component. 
Reflect ALL possible improvements we can make to the component and balance mathematical depth with pedagogical clarity.     
Remember we are ADDING additional content to the component, we are NOT replacing or removing any existing content (unless the existing content is not clear or not pedagogical). 
For each improvement you identity reflect on 5-7 possible solution, distill those down to 1-2 most best solutions and validate your assumptions before we begin implementing the improvement fixes. 
Every improvement should be a pedagogical improvement, not just a mathematical one. 
The target audience is:
-  university students who are learning statistics for the first time (or students struggling with statistics). 
- These students have short attention spans
- These students are not necessarily math majors, but they are required to take statistics for their program
- The content of this application allows them to catch up in class faster.
- understanad content presented at a text book level (for undersgraduate frist semester statistics courses) but in a much more engaging way. 
- we are also helping them do better in their exams. 
- the core promise we are making to the student is this will allow them to pass their Statistics course in a much more efficient way rather than struggling to keep up with the course. 


## Pedagogical Depth
1. UNDERSTAND - Clear explanations of exam-relevant concepts
2. APPLY - Practice problems that mirror homework/tests (with solutions)



### Best Practices to Follow
- **LaTeX Rendering**: ALWAYS follow `/docs/latex-guide.md` exactly - use dangerouslySetInnerHTML pattern
- **Component Reuse**: Use existing VisualizationContainer, GraphContainer, ControlGroup components
- **Chapter 7 Style**: Match the structure and patterns from Chapter 7 components
- **Simplicity First**: Avoid complex drag-and-drop; use controlled, curated interactions
- **Animations**: Follow `/src/components/landing/landing-animations.jsx` for smooth, vibrant animations

### Quality Checklist
- [ ] All LaTeX renders correctly using processMathJax() pattern (`/docs/latex-guide.md`)
- [ ] Component follows existing chapter structure and navigation
- [ ] Animations are smooth (1.5s transitions) and use consistent colors
- [ ] No overlapping or cluttered UI elements
- [ ] All buttons and controls are properly wired up
- [ ] Component includes BackToHub navigation
- [ ] Code follows existing conventions (no unnecessary comments)
- [ ] Make sure the colours are consistent with Chapter 7
- [ ] Font sizes are also consistent with Chapter 7

### Development Process
1. Read and understand the task specification thoroughly
2. Study reference components mentioned in the task file
3. Implement following the exact structure outlined
4. Test all interactions and ensure smooth animations
5. Verify LaTeX rendering and mathematical accuracy

### Final Verification
After implementation, run:
```bash
npm run build && npm run lint
```
