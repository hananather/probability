# Set Theory Pedagogy Updates - SampleSpacesEvents Component

## Summary of Changes
Updated the Sample Spaces and Set Operations visualization to follow proper mathematical education standards for teaching set theory.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Removed Visual U Circle ✅
- **Why**: Universal sets are ALWAYS represented as rectangles in educational materials, never circles
- **Impact**: Aligns with textbook conventions students will encounter

### 2. Updated Visual Representation ✅
- Removed U from the circle data array
- The dark rectangle now represents the universal set
- Added "Universal Set U" label in the top-left corner
- Updated description to clarify the rectangle represents U

### 3. Increased Set Sizes by 40% ✅
- **Before**: A, B, C had radius 0.25 constrained within U circle
- **After**: A, B, C have radius 0.3 with more spread
- **Impact**: Better visibility and more usable space

### 4. Updated Boundary Constraints ✅
- **Before**: Circular constraint based on U's radius
- **After**: Rectangular constraints matching the SVG bounds
- **Function**: `withinBounds()` now uses min/max rectangular bounds

### 5. Updated Interface ✅
- Removed U button from the set builder grid (was 10 buttons, now 9)
- Grid remains 4 columns wide for better layout

### 6. Maintained Mathematical Correctness ✅
- U still exists in the parser as [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
- Complement operations still work correctly
- Users can still type U manually if needed for educational purposes

## Educational Benefits

1. **Standards Compliance**: Matches universal mathematical notation
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear container (rectangle) vs contained (circles) relationship
3. **Eliminates Confusion**: No more trivial operations like U∪A or U∩B
4. **More Space**: 40% larger sets for better interaction
5. **Professional Appearance**: Looks like proper mathematical diagrams

## Technical Implementation

- Split drag functionality to prevent SVG recreation (smooth dragging)
- Direct D3 manipulation during drag, React sync on dragend
- Rectangular bounds checking with padding
- Maintained all existing set operations and parsing logic

## Result
A pedagogically correct, standards-compliant set theory visualization that teaches proper mathematical conventions while providing an excellent interactive learning experience.
