# Chapter 2 Meta-Prompt: Discrete Random Variables

## Purpose
This prompt guides the systematic evaluation and planning for transforming Chapter 2 components into comprehensive learning modules that combine existing distribution visualizations with rigorous mathematical frameworks.

## Core Instruction
For EACH component in Chapter 2, you will create a detailed transformation plan by:
1. Deeply analyzing the current component's distribution visualization
2. Cross-referencing with gold standard patterns (chapters 6.3, 6.9, and 7)
3. Integrating relevant distribution theory from course material
4. Reflecting on multiple approaches before deciding

## Components to Transform

1. `2-1-RandomVariables.jsx`
2. `2-2-DiscreteDistributionsPMFCDF.jsx`
3. `2-3-ExpectedValues.jsx`
4. `2-4-BinomialDistribution.jsx`
5. `2-5-PoissonDistribution.jsx`
6. `2-6-GeometricDistribution.jsx`
7. `2-7-NegativeBinomial.jsx`
8. `2-8-DistributionComparison.jsx`
9. `2-8-DistributionStories.jsx`

## Step-by-Step Process for Each Component

### Step 1: Deep Component Analysis
```
1. Read the current component file completely
2. Identify:
   - Distribution visualization methods
   - Parameter controls and ranges
   - Animation patterns for distribution changes
   - Current formula presentation (if any)
   - Interactive elements (sliders, inputs, etc.)
3. Extract reusable elements:
   - Distribution plotting functions
   - Parameter update handlers
   - Animation configurations
   - Statistical calculation utilities
```

### Step 2: Cross-Reference Gold Standards
```
Review these specific patterns from gold standard components:
- Statistical visualization patterns (charts, distributions)
- Parameter control layouts (grouped controls with labels)
- Formula integration with visualizations
- Real-time calculation updates
- Statistical inference presentations
```

### Step 3: Map Course Material
```
From /course-materials/content/chapter-02-discrete-random-variables.md:
1. Identify distribution-specific content:
   - PMF/CDF formulas
   - Expected value and variance formulas
   - Parameter interpretations
   - Real-world applications
   - Special properties (memoryless, etc.)
2. Note relationships between distributions
3. Extract practical examples for each distribution
```

### Step 4: Multi-Perspective Reflection
```
For each major design decision, consider 5-7 approaches:
1. How to present distribution formulas alongside visualizations
2. How to show parameter effects on distribution shape
3. How to integrate expected value/variance calculations
4. How to demonstrate real-world applications
5. How to show relationships between distributions
6. How to handle edge cases and special properties
7. How to make abstract concepts tangible

Then distill to 1-2 best approaches with justification.
```

### Step 5: Generate Transformation Plan

Structure your plan as follows:

## Special Instructions

### For Distribution Comparisons
1. Ensure consistent scaling across distributions
2. Highlight parameter equivalences
3. Show transformation relationships
4. Maintain visual clarity with multiple plots

### For Heavy Calculations
1. Use memoization for expensive computations
2. Consider web workers for large simulations
3. Implement progressive rendering
4. Add loading states appropriately

### Distribution Relationship Patterns
```jsx
// Show connections between distributions
<DistributionRelationship>
  <Connection 
    from="Binomial(n,p)" 
    to="Poisson(λ)" 
    condition="n→∞, p→0, np=λ"
  />
  <VisualTransition />
</DistributionRelationship>
```

## Key Principles for Statistical Components

1. **Formula-Driven Visualizations**: Every plot connects to its mathematical formula
2. **Parameter Transparency**: Show how parameters affect the distribution
3. **Real-Time Calculations**: Update probabilities as parameters change
4. **Statistical Intuition**: Build understanding through interaction
5. **Practical Applications**: Connect abstract distributions to real scenarios

## Reflection Requirements

For EVERY design decision, ask:
1. Does this clarify the distribution's properties?
2. Is the mathematical foundation clear?
3. Can users see parameter effects immediately?
4. Does the real-world connection make sense?
5. Is statistical accuracy maintained?

## Distribution Checklist

For each distribution component, ensure:
- [ ] PMF and CDF formulas displayed
- [ ] Expected value and variance shown
- [ ] Parameter ranges clearly indicated
- [ ] Special properties highlighted
- [ ] Real-world example integrated
- [ ] Relationship to other distributions noted

## Output Format

For each component, produce a markdown file named:
`/tasks/chapter-2/plans/2-X-ComponentName-plan.md`

Each plan should be self-contained and ready for implementation.

## Remember
You are creating PLANS for statistical learning components. Focus on making abstract probability distributions tangible through thoughtful visualization and clear mathematical presentation.
