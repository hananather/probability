Based on my deep analysis of your codebase, here's what you need to master:
ðŸ”´ ESSENTIAL - Master These First
  1. Tailwind CSS Sizing System
    - Width classes: w-32, w-64, w-full, w-1/3, w-2/3
    - Height classes: h-96, h-full, h-[400px]
    - Padding/margins: p-4, m-2, space-y-4
    - Responsive prefixes: lg:w-2/3, md:grid-cols-2
    - Why critical: This is THE way to resize boxes in your codebase
  2. React useState Hook
    - Basic pattern: const [value, setValue] = useState(initial)
    - Updating state correctly
    - Arrays/objects in state
    - Why critical: 90% of your components use this
  3. JSX & Component Structure
    - How to read/write JSX
    - Props basics: passing and receiving
    - Children prop pattern
    - Why critical: Can't modify components without this
  4. Flexbox & Grid in Tailwind
    - flex, flex-col, flex-row
    - grid, grid-cols-2, gap-4
    - Why critical: Every layout uses these

  ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Learn As Needed (3-4 weeks)

  1. useEffect Hook
    - Basic cleanup pattern
    - Dependency arrays
    - When needed: Only when modifying animations/visualizations
  2. React DevTools
    - Inspecting component props/state
    - Why helpful: Debug why UI isn't changing
  3. Component Composition
    - How your Card/Container components work
    - When to create new components
    - When needed: When building new features

  ðŸŸ¢ LOW PRIORITY - Delegate to LLMs

  1. D3.js Visualizations
    - Complex SVG manipulations
    - Scales, axes, transitions
    - Why delegate: Highly specialized, LLMs handle well
  2. Statistical Calculations
    - jStat library usage
    - Mathematical formulas
    - Why delegate: Domain-specific, not React-related
  3. MathJax/LaTeX
    - LaTeX syntax
    - Queue management
    - Why delegate: Specialized rendering system
  4. Performance Optimizations
    - useMemo, useCallback, React.memo
    - Why delegate: Advanced, not needed initially
  5. Error Boundaries & Suspense
    - Already implemented
    - Why delegate: Rarely need modifications

  ðŸ“š Your 2-Week Action Plan

  Week 1: Tailwind Mastery
  1. Read Tailwind docs on sizing utilities
  2. Practice changing sizes in existing components
  3. Build muscle memory for common patterns:
  // Container with sidebar
  <div className="flex flex-col lg:flex-row gap-6">
    <div className="lg:w-1/3">Controls</div>
    <div className="lg:w-2/3">Visualization</div>
  </div>

  Week 2: React Fundamentals
  1. Master useState with https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory
  2. Practice modifying 3-5 simple components
  3. Understand props flow in your UI components

  ðŸš€ Pro Tips for Your Specific Issues

  "Making a box bigger or smaller":
  1. First check what classes are on the element
  2. Look for: w-, h-, p-, max-w-
  3. Common changes:
    - w-64 â†’ w-96 (bigger)
    - p-4 â†’ p-8 (more spacing)
    - lg:w-1/3 â†’ lg:w-1/2 (wider on desktop)

  Working with LLMs effectively:
  - Ask LLMs to explain Tailwind classes
  - Let them handle D3/statistical code
  - You focus on component structure and state
