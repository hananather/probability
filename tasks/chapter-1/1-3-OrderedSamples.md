# 1.3 Ordered Samples (Permutations)

## Component: `1-3-OrderedSamples.jsx`

### Learning Objectives
- Understand permutations and when order matters
- Calculate permutations with and without replacement
- Apply factorial notation correctly
- Solve real-world ordering problems

### Interactive Elements
1. **Permutation Visualizer**
   - Show all possible arrangements
   - Highlight order importance
   - Compare with/without replacement
   - Animate selection process

2. **Formula Calculator**
   - nPr calculator with steps
   - Factorial computation display
   - Special cases (n=r, r=0, r=1)
   - LaTeX formula rendering

3. **Practice Scenarios**
   - Race finish positions
   - Committee officer selection
   - Scheduling problems
   - Code/password generation

### Key Concepts to Cover
- Permutation definition: nPr = n!/(n-r)!
- With replacement: n^r
- Without replacement: nPr
- Special permutations (circular, with repetition)
- Connection to counting principle

### Visual Design
- Slot-based visualization
- Color-coded selections
- Step-by-step formula breakdown
- Clear distinction between arrangements

### Implementation Notes
- Limit visualizations to small n (â‰¤8) for clarity
- Show calculation steps
- Include common mistakes section
- Provide formula cheat sheet
