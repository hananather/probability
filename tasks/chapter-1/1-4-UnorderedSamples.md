# 1.4 Unordered Samples (Combinations)

## Component: `1-4-UnorderedSamples.jsx`

### Learning Objectives
- Understand combinations and when order doesn't matter
- Calculate binomial coefficients
- Apply Pascal's triangle
- Distinguish between permutations and combinations

### Interactive Elements
1. **Combination Visualizer**
   - Show groupings without order
   - Compare to permutations side-by-side
   - Highlight why order doesn't matter
   - Visual selection process

2. **Binomial Coefficient Calculator**
   - nCr = n!/(r!(n-r)!)
   - Step-by-step calculation
   - Pascal's triangle generator
   - Special properties explorer

3. **Real-World Applications**
   - Lottery number selection
   - Team formation
   - Pizza topping combinations
   - Card hand problems

### Key Concepts to Cover
- Combination formula derivation
- Relationship: nCr = nPr/r!
- Symmetry property: nCr = nC(n-r)
- Sum of row in Pascal's triangle = 2^n
- Binomial theorem connection

### Visual Design
- Set-based visualization
- Pascal's triangle animation
- Side-by-side comparison with permutations
- Interactive formula manipulation

### Implementation Notes
- Clear visual distinction from permutations
- Emphasize "choosing" vs "arranging"
- Include combination identities
- Practice problems with solutions
