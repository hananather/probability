# 1.6 Conditional Probability & Independence

## Component: `1-6-ConditionalProbability.jsx`

### Learning Objectives
- Master conditional probability P(A|B)
- Understand independence of events
- Apply multiplication rule
- Use Law of Total Probability

### Interactive Elements
1. **Conditional Probability Visualizer**
   - P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B)
   - Shrinking sample space animation
   - Before/after conditioning view
   - Tree diagram representation

2. **Independence Tester**
   - Check if P(A|B) = P(A)
   - Multiple event comparisons
   - Visual proof of independence
   - Counter-intuitive examples

3. **Probability Trees**
   - Multi-stage experiments
   - Branch probabilities
   - Path multiplication
   - Total probability calculation

### Key Concepts to Cover
- Conditional probability definition
- Independence: P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B)
- Multiplication rule variants
- Law of Total Probability
- Partition of sample space

### Visual Design
- Nested Venn diagrams
- Tree diagrams with probabilities
- Before/after conditioning comparison
- Color-coded probability paths

### Implementation Notes
- Emphasize "given that" interpretation
- Show both formula approaches
- Include medical testing examples
- Highlight independence misconceptions
