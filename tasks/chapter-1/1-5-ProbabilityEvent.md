# 1.5 Probability of an Event

## Component: `1-5-ProbabilityEvent.jsx`

### Learning Objectives
- Apply classical probability definition
- Understand probability axioms
- Use addition rule for probability
- Calculate probabilities from counting

### Interactive Elements
1. **Probability Calculator**
   - Visual representation of P(A) = |A|/|S|
   - Favorable vs total outcomes
   - Probability bar visualization
   - Multiple event calculator

2. **Addition Rule Explorer**
   - P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)
   - Interactive Venn diagram
   - Show overlap importance
   - Special cases (disjoint events)

3. **Probability Axioms Demo**
   - 0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1
   - P(S) = 1, P(∅) = 0
   - Complement rule: P(A') = 1 - P(A)
   - Interactive verification

### Key Concepts to Cover
- Classical probability definition
- Equally likely outcomes assumption
- Probability as long-run frequency
- Addition rule derivation
- Complement rule applications

### Visual Design
- Probability scale (0 to 1)
- Area-based visualizations
- Color gradients for probability values
- Interactive probability wheels

### Implementation Notes
- Connect to previous counting sections
- Show probability as fraction/decimal/percentage
- Include common probability mistakes
- Real-world probability examples
