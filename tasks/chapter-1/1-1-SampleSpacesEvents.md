# 1.1 Sample Spaces and Events

## Component: `1-1-SampleSpacesEvents.jsx`

### Learning Objectives
- Understand sample spaces as the set of all possible outcomes
- Master set operations: union, intersection, complement
- Create and interpret Venn diagrams
- Apply De Morgan's laws

### Interactive Elements
1. **Sample Space Builder**
   - Visual representation of sample spaces
   - Add/remove outcomes interactively
   - Examples: coin flips, dice rolls, card draws

2. **Set Operations Visualizer**
   - Interactive Venn diagrams
   - Drag elements between sets
   - Show union, intersection, complement operations
   - Real-time formula updates

3. **Practice Problems**
   - Identify sample spaces for various experiments
   - Calculate set operations
   - Solve word problems using Venn diagrams

### Key Concepts to Cover
- Definition of sample space (S)
- Events as subsets of S
- Empty set (âˆ…) and universal set
- Set notation and operations
- Mutually exclusive events
- Exhaustive events

### Visual Design
- Use circles/ovals for Venn diagrams
- Color coding for different sets
- Smooth transitions when elements move
- Clear labeling of regions

### Implementation Notes
- NO draggable components (per best practices)
- Use controlled animations
- Focus on clarity over complexity
- Mobile-responsive layout
