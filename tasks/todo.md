  - **Weather Analysis**: Compare temperature variability between seasons/locations
  - **Sports Analytics**: Analyze performance consistency across teams/players
  - **Financial Markets**: Compare volatility between different assets
  - **Education**: Compare test score variance between teaching methods
- Each scenario should include:
  - Context-specific visualizations

## Implementation Priority
1. Enhanced Particle Animation (High impact on learning)
2. Visual F-Ratio Animation (High visual appeal)
3. Interactive Practice Problems (High educational value)
4. Progress Tracking Dashboard (Medium - improves engagement)
5. Additional Real-World Scenarios (Medium - adds variety)
6. F-Distribution Playground (Low - advanced feature)
7. Cross-Component Integration (Low - depends on other components)

## Technical Considerations
- Ensure all animations are performant on lower-end devices
- Add accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
- Consider adding a "reduced motion" mode for animations
- Implement proper error handling for user-uploaded data
- Add comprehensive testing for statistical calculations

## Chapter 4 - Remaining Tasks from Analysis

### 1. Create Statistical Thinking Introduction
**Component**: `4-0-1-StatisticalThinking.jsx`
- Create an introduction component for Chapter 4 that sets the stage
- Include:
  - Why we need statistics (uncertainty in engineering)
  - Preview of all concepts with visual metaphors
  - Interactive roadmap of the chapter
  - Connection to real-world engineering problems
- Acts as a landing page/hub for Chapter 4

### 2. Improve F-Distribution Components
**Components to improve**:
- `4-5-1-FDistributionExplorer.jsx` - Already has hub structure, needs content components
- `4-5-2-FDistributionWorkedExample.jsx` (Grade: C-) - Very static, needs interactivity

**New components to create**:
- `4-5-1-FDistributionIntuitiveIntro.jsx` - Visual introduction to "why compare variances"
- `4-5-2-FDistributionInteractiveJourney.jsx` - Guided exploration with achievements
- `4-5-3-FDistributionMastery.jsx` - Real-world applications

**Key improvements needed**:
- Start with practical context (quality control, comparing production lines)
- Visual metaphor for variance comparison before formulas
- Interactive variance explorer before F-statistic
- Connect to ANOVA preview

### 3. Pattern Consistency Updates
