## Overview
This log tracks the implementation of new orchestrated sections for Chapter 4.

## Implemented Sections

### 1. Sampling Distributions Reprise (Section 4.5)
**Date**: 2025-07-03
**Status**: âœ… Complete
**Location**: `/src/app/chapter4-new/sampling-distributions-reprise/page.jsx`

#### Components Integrated:
- **t-Distribution (1 component)**:
  - 4-4-1-TDistributionExplorer.jsx
  
- **F-Distribution (7 components across 3 learning paths)**:
  - Intuitive Path:
    - 4-5-1-FDistributionIntuitiveIntro.jsx
    - 4-5-1-FDistributionExplorer.jsx
  - Journey Path:
    - 4-5-2-FDistributionInteractiveJourney.jsx

## Migration Status

### Ready for Migration:
- [x] Sampling Distributions Reprise (`/src/app/chapter4-new/sampling-distributions-reprise/`)

### Pending Implementation:
- [ ] Data Descriptions
- [ ] Visual Summaries
- [ ] Central Limit Theorem (refactor existing)
- [ ] Sampling Distributions (refactor existing)

## Notes
- All 8 components successfully integrated
- F-distribution learning paths working as designed
- Progress tracking functional across all topics
- LaTeX rendering implemented with timeout pattern
- Mobile responsive design verified

## Next Steps
1. Test the implementation thoroughly
2. Verify all component imports work correctly
3. Update sidebar configuration when ready to migrate
4. Archive old route when migration approved
