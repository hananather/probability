# Goals
1. Conceptual Building: Each component builds on the previous
2. Active Learning: quizes, not mindlessly clicking buttons but rather using the simulations to answer questions



# Custom Memory Students (ADVANCED FEATURE)

For each module, based on which questions student struggled with the most, we keep track of this information.
This information will be key in customizing the user experience in several ways:
1) Concepts to review from each chapter
2) When there is a midterm comming this can generate a custom plan for the student to reivew **concepts in the correct order**.
We can leverage space repetition to help students remember important concepts.


# Voice Mode
To be safe let make sure nothing on the application "requires" voice mode. The main objective with voice integration is to (1) make the application more accessible to use (2) make the application more engaging



---
## Example flow:
1. User goes to the module.
2. There needs to be a hook to grab the students attention. This will be different for every module. What are some pontentail ideas. This is an area we can experiment with. The most interesting one is asking the student a question in voice mode, and asking the student to respond using voice mode. These question can be cached in voice mode. It should be relatable.
Like "you are probabiliy being forced to take this Statistics course for your program, and you are probably thinking to yourself, why should I even care about Random varibles?". Let me begin by asking you a question


## Example Flow:
1. The begins a new module.
2. Engaging hook is introduces the concept and captures the student's attention. This hook will vary for each module (opportunity for experimentation).
  - One idea is to ask the student a question
  - we can experiemt with voice mode encouraging a vocal response.
  These questions should be memorable and relatable, such as:
   - "You're likely required to take this statistics course for your program. You might be wondering, 'Why should I even care about random variables?' Let's start by asking you a question."
