There needs to be a consistent flow to the application. I don't know exactly what that is yet, we need to experiment.


---
## Example flow:
1. User goes to the module.
2. There needs to be a hook to grab the students attention. This will be different for every module. What are some pontentail ideas. This is an area we can experiment with. The most interesting one is asking the student a question in voice mode, and asking the student to respond using voice mode. These question can be cached in voice mode. It should be relatable.
Like "you are probabiliy being forced to take this Statistics course for your program, and you are probably thinking to yourself, why should I even care about Random varibles?". Let me begin by asking you a question


## Example Flow:
1. The begins a new module.
2. Engaging hook is introduces the concept and captures the student's attention. This hook will vary for each module (opportunity for experimentation).
  - One idea is to ask the student a question
  - we can experiemt with voice mode encouraging a vocal response.
  These questions should be memorable and relatable, such as:
   - "You're likely required to take this statistics course for your program. You might be wondering, 'Why should I even care about random variables?' Let's start by asking you a question."

Pages should begin with a tutorial using `import { Tutorial } from '../ui/Tutorial';`.
We don't want this tutorial to be annoying, the objective is simply so the users can see functionality of the component.


## Random thoughts
I think there is a much better way to do the tutorial. Rather than a series of states the users click next, it could be more interactively embedded within the application.
Obviously this interaction is harder to build but something we can experiment with.
