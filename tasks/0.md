# Goals
1. Conceptual Building: Each component builds on the previous
2. Active Learning: quizes, not mindlessly clicking buttons but rather using the simulations to answer questions

# Components
We need to do a component by component analysis on what concepts is each component attempting to teach. And lets classify them based on these concepts.

# Custom Memory Students

For each module, based on which questions student struggled with the most, we keep track of this information.
This information will be key in customizing the user experience in several ways:
1) Concepts to review from each chapter
2) When there is a midterm comming this can generate a custom plan for the student to reivew **concepts in the correct order**.
We can leverage space repetition to help students remember important concepts.

# Voice Mode
To be safe let make sure nothing on the application "requires" voice mode. The main objective with voice integration is to (1) make the application more accessible to use (2) make the application more engaging


# Page flow

There needs to be a consistent flow to the application. Content on the page should reveled as the student progresses.
- How can I do this? Each page goes be a series of sections?
- There should be a progress bar at the top that keeps track.

## Example flow:
1. User goes to the module.
2. There needs to be a hook to grab the students attention. This will be different for every module. What are some pontentail ideas. This is an area we can experiment with. The most interesting one is asking the student a question in voice mode, and asking the student to respond using voice mode. These question can be cached in voice mode. It should be relatable.
Like "you are probabiliy being forced to take this Statistics course for your program, and you are probably thinking to yourself, why should I even care about Random varibles?". Let me begin by asking you a question


## Example Flow:
1. The begins a new module.
2. Engaging hook is introduces the concept and captures the student's attention. This hook will vary for each module (opportunity for experimentation).
  - One idea is to ask the student a question
  - we can experiemt with voice mode encouraging a vocal response.
  These questions should be memorable and relatable, such as:
   - "You're likely required to take this statistics course for your program. You might be wondering, 'Why should I even care about random variables?' Let's start by asking you a question."

# 2
Pages should begin with a tutorial using `import { Tutorial } from '../ui/Tutorial';`.
We don't want this tutorial to be annoying, the objective is simply so the users can see functionality of the component.


## Random thoughts
I think there is a much better way to do the tutorial. Rather than a series of states the users click next, it could be more interactively embedded within the application.
Obviously this interaction is harder to build but something we can experiment with.
