# UI Fixes Completed - SampleSpacesEvents Component

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Label Placement ✅
**Problem**: Letters A and B were being covered/overlapping when initially loaded
**Solution**: 
- Adjusted initial positions from `cx: 0.35/0.65` to `cx: 0.3/0.7` for better spacing
- Reduced radius from `0.3` to `0.25` to prevent overlap
- Result: All labels are clearly visible on load

### 2. Evaluated Region Visibility ✅
**Problem**: Evaluated regions were not visible when clicking "Evaluate"
**Solution**:
- Changed highlight color from `colorScheme.chart.tertiary` to high-contrast yellow `#fbbf24`
- Increased opacity from `0.3` to `0.6` for better visibility
- Added smooth transitions (300ms) for visual feedback
- Result: Selected regions are now clearly visible with bright yellow highlighting

### 3. Region Filling ✅
**Problem**: Regions weren't filling properly when evaluated
**Solution**:
- Fixed the `updateIntersection()` function to properly set opacity
- Changed opacity logic to use `0.6` when selected, `0` when not
- Ensured transitions work smoothly
- Result: Regions now fill completely with proper visual feedback

## Technical Implementation

```javascript
// Better initial positions
const [setData, setSetData] = useState([
  {name: 'A', cx: 0.3, cy: 0.35, r: 0.25},
  {name: 'B', cx: 0.7, cy: 0.35, r: 0.25},
  {name: 'C', cx: 0.5, cy: 0.7, r: 0.25}
]);

// High-contrast highlighting
const fill = currentSet.includes(i) ? '#fbbf24' : 'transparent';
const opacity = currentSet.includes(i) ? 0.6 : 0;
section
  .transition()
  .duration(300)
  .style('fill', fill)
  .style('opacity', opacity);
```

## Color Theory Applied

- **Yellow (#fbbf24)**: Chosen for maximum contrast against dark background
- **60% opacity**: Balances visibility with ability to see underlying elements
- **Smooth transitions**: Provides visual feedback and professional feel

## Result
- Labels are always visible and don't overlap
- Evaluated regions are highly visible with bright yellow highlighting
- Smooth animations enhance user experience
- Follows accessibility best practices for contrast
