# Quiz Component Refactor - TODO List

## Overview
Refactor the quiz component to be a clean, reusable shared UI component that can be used across all future quizzes in the application.

## TODO Items

### 1. Clean Up Current Quiz Component
- **Task**: Remove excessive bounce animations and junk code from QuizBreak component
- **Location**: `src/components/mdx/QuizBreak.jsx`
- **Details**: 
  - Remove `animate-bounce` classes from icons
  - Remove `animate-pulse` from selected states
  - Keep only subtle, clean transitions (duration-200, hover effects)
  - Simplify animation logic to essential feedback only
- **Context**: Component currently has too many distracting animations that hurt UX

### 2. Move Quiz Component to Shared UI Components
- **Task**: Move cleaned quiz component to shared UI directory
- **From**: `src/components/mdx/QuizBreak.jsx`
- **To**: `src/components/ui/Quiz.jsx`
- **Details**:
  - Create new `Quiz.jsx` component in UI directory
  - Export main quiz component and any sub-components
  - Update all imports across the codebase
  - Ensure backward compatibility with existing usage

### 3. Create Component Catalog Entry
- **Task**: Add Quiz component to the UI component catalog
- **Location**: Update component showcase/catalog (likely in UI section)
- **Details**:
  - Document component props and usage examples
  - Show single question and multiple question variants
  - Include styling options and customization examples
  - Add to component library documentation

### 4. Standardize Quiz Component API
- **Task**: Create consistent, clean API for quiz component
- **Details**:
  - Support both `correct` and `correctIndex` props (maintain backward compatibility)
  - Standardize prop names and structure
  - Add TypeScript definitions if needed
  - Create clear documentation for all props and methods

### 5. Refactor Existing Quiz Usage
- **Task**: Update all existing quiz implementations to use new shared component
- **Locations**: 
  - `src/content/lesson-based-approach.mdx`
  - Any other files using QuizBreak component
- **Details**:
  - Update import statements
  - Ensure all existing functionality works
  - Test all quiz interactions and animations

### 6. Create Quiz Component Tests
- **Task**: Add comprehensive tests for the quiz component
- **Location**: Create test file alongside component
- **Details**:
  - Test single question functionality
  - Test multiple question functionality
  - Test correct/incorrect answer detection
  - Test completion callbacks
  - Test animation states

### 7. Documentation and Examples
- **Task**: Create comprehensive documentation for the quiz component
- **Details**:
  - Usage examples for different scenarios
  - Props documentation
  - Styling customization guide
  - Integration examples with other components

### 8. Performance Optimization
- **Task**: Ensure quiz component is optimized for performance
- **Details**:
  - Minimize re-renders
  - Optimize animation performance
  - Ensure proper cleanup of event listeners
  - Test with large numbers of questions

## Implementation Priority
1. **High Priority**: Items 1-3 (Clean up, move to UI, basic catalog entry)
2. **Medium Priority**: Items 4-5 (API standardization, refactor usage)
3. **Low Priority**: Items 6-8 (Tests, documentation, optimization)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Quiz component is clean and minimal with essential animations only
- [ ] Component is located in shared UI directory and properly cataloged
- [ ] All existing quiz functionality works without breaking changes
- [ ] Component can be easily reused for future quiz implementations
- [ ] Code is well-documented and maintainable

## Notes
- Maintain backward compatibility during refactor
- Focus on clean, subtle animations rather than distracting effects
- Ensure component follows existing UI component patterns in the codebase
- Consider accessibility requirements for quiz interactions
