## Summary Statistics

### Implementation Coverage by Chapter

- Chapter 5: 40% implemented (missing sample size, proportions)
- Chapter 6: 30% implemented (missing most practical tests)
- Chapter 7: 0% implemented (entire chapter missing)

### Overall Platform Coverage: ~47%

## Priority Missing Components

### High Priority (Core Concepts)
1. **Bayes' Theorem Visualizer** (Ch 1.7)
2. **Discrete Distributions Suite** (Ch 2.3-2.6)
3. **Regression Explorer** (Ch 7 - entire chapter)
4. **Hypothesis Test Suite** (Ch 6.4-6.9)
5. **Joint Distributions** (Ch 3.6)

### Medium Priority (Important Extensions)
1. Law of Total Probability (Ch 1.6b)
2. Sample Size Calculator (Ch 5.3)
3. Proportion Confidence Intervals (Ch 5.5)
4. Box Plots and Quartiles (Ch 4.1d, 4.2b)
5. Power Analysis (Ch 6.1b)

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. Probabilistic Fallacies (Ch 1 Appendix)

3. Factorial Explorer (Ch 1.3c)
4. Outlier Detection (Ch 4.1e)

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action**: Implement Chapter 7 (Regression) as it's completely missing
2. **Quick Wins**: Add missing discrete distributions to Chapter 2
3. **Educational Impact**: Implement Bayes' Theorem for Chapter 1 completion
4. **Practical Value**: Build comprehensive hypothesis testing suite
5. **Advanced Topics**: Add joint distributions for complete probability coverage

## Implementation Approach

For each missing component:
1. Review course material for educational objectives
2. Check visualization roadmap for design guidance
3. Follow CLTSimulation.jsx pattern for consistency
4. Include 4-stage educational insights
5. Add dynamic worked examples
6. Implement progress tracking
